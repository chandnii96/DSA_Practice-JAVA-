/*
Given a 2D grid of n*m of characters and a word, find all occurrences of given word in grid. A word can be matched in all 8 directions at any point. Word is said to be found in a direction if all characters match in this direction (not in zig-zag form). The 8 directions are, horizontally left, horizontally right, vertically up, vertically down, and 4 diagonal directions.

Note: The returning list should be lexicographically smallest. If the word can be found in multiple directions starting from the same coordinates, the list should contain the coordinates only once. 

Example 1:

Input: 
grid = {{a,b,c},{d,r,f},{g,h,i}},
word = "abc"
Output: 
{{0,0}}
Explanation: 
From (0,0) we can find "abc" in horizontally right direction.
