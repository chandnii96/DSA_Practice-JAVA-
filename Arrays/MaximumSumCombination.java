/*
Given two integer array A and B of size N each.
A sum combination is made by adding one element from array A and another element of array B.
Return the maximum K valid sum combinations from all the possible sum combinations.

Note : Output array must be sorted in non-increasing order.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
K = 2
A [ ] = {3, 2}
B [ ] = {1, 4}
Output: {7, 6}
Explanation: 
7 -> (A : 3) + (B : 4)
6 -> (A : 2) + (B : 4)
